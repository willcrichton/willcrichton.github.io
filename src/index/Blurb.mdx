My goal is to empower people to use the full potential of computers through programming.
To reach that potential, we need to combine a science of programming with a science of people.
For me, these sciences are *programming language theory* and *cognitive psychology*, respectively.
My research draws on these fields to make programming more usable, learnable, and powerful.

I am an assistant professor at Brown University, where I lead the [Cognitive Engineering Lab].
Previously, I completed my PhD at Stanford, advised by [Pat Hanrahan] and [Maneesh Agrawala].
I did a postdoc also at Brown with [Shriram Krishnamurthi].

I do research primarily between <abbr title="Programming Languages">PL</abbr> and <abbr title="Human-Computer Interaction">HCI</abbr>.
I build systems like [program slicers][flowistry] <span style={{ whiteSpace: "no-wrap" }}><StarCount repo="willcrichton/flowistry" />,</span> [document languages][nota] <span style={{ whiteSpace: "no-wrap" }}><StarCount repo="nota-lang/nota" />,</span> and [type system visualizers][aquascope] <StarCount repo="cognitive-engineering-lab/aquascope" />.
I develop theories like <Ref id="cah:wm-tracing">working memory for programmers</Ref>, <Ref id="ck:profiling-learning">psychometrics for programming languages</Ref>, and <Ref id="ck:document-calculus">type-safe templates for <span className="nobr">System F</span></Ref>.
I work on systems languages like <Ref id="sec-rust">Rust</Ref>, proof assistants like <Ref id="sec-proofs">Lean</Ref>, and <abbr>UI</abbr> tools like <Ref id="sec-browser">the browser</Ref>.
My Rust research has been used by over 100,000 developers to date. My research garden (below) explains my current interests in greater detail.
