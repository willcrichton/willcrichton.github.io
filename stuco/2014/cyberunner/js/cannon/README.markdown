# cannon.js

### Lightweight 3D physics for the web
Inspired by [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) and [ammo.js](https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js), and driven by the fact that the web lacks a physics engine, here comes cannon.js.
The rigid body physics engine includes simple collision detection, various body shapes, contacts, friction and constraints.

[Demos](http://schteppe.github.com/cannon.js) - [Documentation](http://schteppe.github.com/cannon.js/doc/) - [Rendering hints](https://github.com/schteppe/cannon.js/tree/master/examples) - [NPM package](https://npmjs.org/package/cannon)

### Usage
Optionally, start by building the library using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).

Include [build/cannon.js](build/cannon.js) in your html:

```html
<script src="cannon.js"></script>
```

Then you can start experimenting.

The sample code below creates a sphere on a plane, steps the simulation, and prints the sphere simulation to the console. Note that Cannon.js uses [SI units](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) (metre, kilogram, second, etc.).

```javascript
// Setup our world
var world = new CANNON.World();
world.gravity.set(0,0,-9.82); // m/s²
world.broadphase = new CANNON.NaiveBroadphase();

// Create a sphere
var mass = 5,   // kg
    radius = 1; // m
var sphereShape = new CANNON.Sphere(radius);
var sphereBody = new CANNON.RigidBody(mass,sphereShape);
sphereBody.position.set(0,0,10); // m
world.add(sphereBody);

// Create a plane
var groundShape = new CANNON.Plane();
var groundBody = new CANNON.RigidBody(0,groundShape); // mass == 0 makes the body static
world.add(groundBody);

// Step the simulation
setInterval(function(){
  var timeStep = 1.0/60.0; // seconds
  world.step(timeStep);
  console.log("Sphere z position: " + sphereBody.position.z);
}, 1000.0/60.0);
```

If you want to know how to use cannon.js with a rendering engine, for example Three.js, see the [Examples](examples).

### Change log
**Current (to be 0.6.0)**
 * Added class ```Spring```.
 * Added class ```TupleDictionary```.
 * Renamed the ```'collide'``` event ```.with``` property to ```.body```.
 * Renamed ```ObjectPool``` to just ```Pool```.
 * Added methods ```.transpose```, ```.setRotationFromQuaternion```, ```.scale``` to class ```Mat3```.
 * Added class ```SAP1DBroadphase```.
 * World now dispatches events ```'addBody'``` and ```'removeBody'```.
 * Added method ```.setFromEuler``` to ```Quaternion```.
 * Changed API for adding forces and impulses to a body. See ```RigidBody.addImpulse``` and ```RigidBody.addForce```.
 * Removed ```World.collision_matrix``` and instead added ```World.collisionMatrix``` and ```World.collisionMatrixPrevious```. They both now work with body indices instead of body IDs.
 * Added ```SPHSystem```.
 * Renamed ```RigidBody.calculateAABB``` to ```.computeAABB```. Added ```RigidBody.aabbNeedsUpdate```.
 * Added ```Broadphase.useBoundingBoxes```, ```.doBoundingBoxBroadphase``` and ```.intersectionTest```.
 * ```ConvexPolyhedron``` constructor now calculates normals instead of taking them as a parameter.
 * Added ```Body.collisionFilterGroup``` and ```Body.collisionFilterMask```.
 * Added ```GridBroadphase```, though it only supports ```Plane``` and ```Sphere``` for now.
 * Removed World.temp.
 * Reuse of various event objects to minimize object creation in the step loop.
 * Removed unused class ```ContactPoint```.
 * Changed the signature of ```Broadphase.collisionPairs``` to ```Broadphase.collisionPairs(world,pairs1,pairs2)```, removing the need of an array return value.

**0.5.0**
 * Changed unit of sleep properties in ```Particle``` to seconds instead of milliseconds, made ```Particle.sleepState``` public. (schteppe,airbaggins).
 * Changed property ```Shape.boundingSphereRadius``` to being a number, added method ```Shape.computeBoundingSphereRadius``` and ```.boundingSphereRadiusNeedsUpdate```
 * Removed ```Box.getCorners```
 * Added properties to ```ContactMaterial```:  ```.contactEquationStiffness```, ```.contactEquationRegularizationTime```, ```.frictionEquationStiffness```, ```.frictionEquationRegularizationTime``` to be able to control settings for the on-the-fly created contact constraints
 * Renamed the solver parameter "damping" to "regularizationTime", since it is a more correct name.
 * Solver parameters (stiffness, damping etc) were moved from ```Solver``` to ```Equation```. Now you control the solver parameters per constraint instead of globally.
 * Added ```HingeConstraint``` and its ```Constraint``` base class
 * Added contact support for all possible ```Shape.types``` (see table above).
 * Fixed convex contact bugs.
 * Added method ```ConvexPolyhedron.getAveragePointLocal```.
 * Added method ```ConvexPolyhedron.transformAllPoints```.
 * Added ```SplitSolver```.
 * Removed use of typed arrays, since they are slower than ordinary ones.
 * Corrected applying of linear and angular damping, should now be physically correct and independent of timestep size.
 * Renamed ```Solver``` to ```GSSolver```, made ```Solver``` a base class instead.
 * Added method ```Mat3.setTrace```
 * ```ContactGenerator``` now produces ```ContactEquation``` instead of ```ContactPoint```
 * Added property ```Solver.tolerance```
 * Changed default ```Solver``` parameter values
 * Improved ```Solver``` algorithm, the parameters ```.a```, ```.b```, ```.k```, ```.d```, ```.eps``` do not have the same effect anymore.
 * Rewrote ```Solver```, ```Equation``` and ```Constraint``` totally, broke backward compatibility.
 * Added property ```World.enableImpulses``` - still an experimental feature
 * Added ```PointToPointConstraint```
 * Added ```Cylinder```.
 * Added method ```RigidBody.applyImpulse```
 * Added "iterator" method ```Box.forEachWorldCorner```
 * Added "abstract method" ```Shape.calculateWorldAABB``` and implemented it in subclasses.
 * Removed ```Plane.normal``` in favor of ```RigidBody.quaternion```. One way to rotate a plane is enough.

**0.4.3**
 * ```World``` now dispatches "preStep" and "postStep" events.
 * Introduced ```Body``` and ```Particle```. New inheritance: ```Body``` -> ```Particle``` -> ```RigidBody```.
 * Added ```Quaternion.toAxisAngle()```
 * Added ```Ray```. Basic hit testing for ```ConvexPolyhedra```.
 * ```RigidBody``` now dispatches the following events: ```"collide"```, ```"sleep"```, ```"sleepy"```, ```"wakeup"```
 * Added ```Solver.setSpookParams(k,d)``` and removed SPOOK param things from ```World```.
 * Sleep functionality for ```RigidBody```

**0.4.2** 2012-08-06
 * Code seem stable enough to start a change log.
