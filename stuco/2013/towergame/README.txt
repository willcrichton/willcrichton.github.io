Try to escape the clouds for as long as possible.

Controls:
Left/right: Move
Up: Jump
Down: Fast fall/fall through platforms
QWER/ASDF: Drop a building. Can only drop one if you're standing and it won't
overlap any other buildings. Each building has a recharge bar, located in the
bottom right, before you can place it again.
Special build types:
W: Turret (kills enemies nearby)
E: Trampoline (bounces you if you hit the top while not moving left/right)
R: Generator (makes bars charge faster if one's on screen)

Enemies destroy platforms upon contact. Any platform not supported (has a
platform underneath on both sides of the center of mass) breaks as well. They
stop existing upon going off the bottom of the screen.

F5 it if you find it covered in cloud.
