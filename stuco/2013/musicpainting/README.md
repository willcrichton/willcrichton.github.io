Music-Painting
==============

README
	
	Music-Painting is an audio visualization program that plays music while displaying
	explosions that vary in size correlated to the volume of the music. Our visualization
	is modeled after the sort of fireworks you would see at DisneyWorld (we added a castle!)
	This is our first significant project written in JavaScript and will be quite a learning
	experience.

Basic Idea

	* Parse the song for volume

	* As the song plays, explosions go off at random points around the castle, like fireworks
	
	* The explosions vary in color randomly while varying in size in accordance to the volume
	  of the music.
