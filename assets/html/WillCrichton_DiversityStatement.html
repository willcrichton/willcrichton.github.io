<h1 class="title">Diversity Statement &nbsp; &middot; &nbsp; Will Crichton</h1>
</header>
<p>
Across the different institutions and CS sub-disciplines I have worked
in, I have seen enormous variation in the diversity of student
populations. Carnegie Mellon’s undergraduate CS program does an
excellent job at maintaining a roughly 50/50 gender ratio, in comparison
to Stanford’s abysmal 73% male / 26% female split in the CS Ph.D.
program. The HCI and CS education research communities do an excellent
job at recruiting and retaining diverse students, while the programming
languages and systems research communities are extremely homogeneous by
comparison. This experience is a stark reminder that there is not just a
“pipeline problem” but a community problem — people from
underrepresented groups join communities that welcome them, and they
avoid communities that don’t. I strongly believe that (a) all people
deserve the opportunity to study computer science in any sub-discipline
from undergraduate to the Ph.D., and (b) it is everyone’s responsibility
to take active steps to foster an inclusive community.</p>
<p>At the community level, I take strides to foster inclusivity by
organizing events that help people from underrepresented groups connect
to researchers and get research experience. For example, I organized the
Stanford CS Ph.D. Admitted Student Weekend for six years, and I was
given the Student Service Award all six years for my efforts. As a part
of that role, I organized student Q&amp;A panels that would help
admitted students learn from current students whether Stanford was a
good fit for them. First, I ensured that the panel was a safe space for
discussion by excluding faculty and disabling video recording. Second, I
recruited student panelists from a wide variety of backgrounds to give
their perspectives, such as: women, students of color, LGBTQ+ students,
international students, and students with children. These panels helped
illuminate the lived experience of students from underrepresented groups
at Stanford, and ultimately helped admitted students make an informed
choice of which grad school to attend.</p>
<p>At the individual level, I do both outreach and mentoring with a
focus on facilitating diversity. For example, for the last decade I have
annually returned to visit the public high school I attended in Des
Moines, Iowa. Most students there do not know anyone with a Ph.D., and
so I give talks and answer questions about the experience of attending
graduate school and studying computer science. During my Ph.D. program,
I mentored several students from underrepresented groups. <em>Note:
specifics are redacted in the public version of this statement to
respect the privacy of my mentees.</em></p>
<p>Once I become faculty, my immediate goal will be to recruit a diverse
group of Ph.D. students to mentor. I have seen time and again how
professors will unthinkingly recruit a homogeneous group, and then be
unable to improve their group’s diversity years down the line. I hope to
avoid that mistake by factoring in diversity from Year 1. That goal goes
hand-in-hand with building a welcoming environment: regularly
checking-in with my grad students for their well-being, and providing
spaces for open discussion without fear of reprisal or domination. I
will also seek to foster an inclusive attitude in my courses by setting
standards for discourse: discouraging show-off behavior and claims that
only certain kinds of people will “get” the material. By combining these
practices with an ongoing reflection on my successes and failures, I
hope to contribute towards a community where everyone feels welcome to
learn and work together.</p>
