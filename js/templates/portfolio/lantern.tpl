<a href="/thesis.pdf" target="_blank">Lantern</a> is my senior thesis advised by <a href="http://cs.cmu.edu/~kayvonf" target="_blank">Kayvon Fatahalian</a>. I explored a language and runtime for modeling and finding concepts, or ideas of interest, in images or video, e.g. busy intersections, suspicious persons, or cellular vesicles. I developed a prototype system and evaluated effectiveness against multiple applications across computer vision, computational biology, and art history.
