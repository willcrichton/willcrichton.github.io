What do we know about how people think when they program? What research lies at the intersection of psychology and programming? In trying to answer these questions, I've read through dozens of papers spanning psychology, cognitive science, human-computer interaction, and software engineering ranging from the late 1960s to today. In this note, I will retell an abridged history of this body of work that seems to have been all but forgotten.

## Structured programming

Much of the early interest in the psychology of programming started in the 1970s, around the time when programming language design became a hotly contested topic. At the time, the major flashpoint in the debate was the use of GOTOs versus structured programming (ifs and whiles), famously inflamed by Dijkstra's 1968 essay "Go To Considered Harmful". Like much of the software engineering discourse today, the arguments made by Dijkstra and others were largely drawn from opinion, personal experience, and critical thinking.
