      <h1>Community of Practice / Community of Theory</h1>
      <p><i>Will Crichton, 8/3/2023</i></p>
      <p>
        Several years ago, an incoming Ph.D. student asked me for advice about
        how to do good research in PL/HCI (programming languages and
        human-computer interaction). The advice I gave them at the time was:
      </p>
      <center>
        <strong>Find a community of practice.</strong>
      </center>
      <p>
        With a few years of hindsight, I would now amend this advice to say:
      </p>
      <center>
        <strong
          >Find a community of practice <em>and</em> a community of
          theory.</strong
        >
      </center>
      <p>
        In short, a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice"
          ><em>community of practice</em></a
        >
        is a group of people who share a central activity or technology that
        they learn and work with together. My main community of practice is
        "people who use Rust." I have a colleague in the community of practice
        of "people who knit." One of my former advisors is in the community of
        practice of "people who design self-driving cars."
      </p>
      <p>
        A community of practice is valuable because it helps you find important
        problems. You get to understand the day-to-day challenges of engaging in
        the practice. The people in the community can give you feedback on your
        ideas from the perspective of real-world use, as opposed to
        hypotheticals. When you succeed in doing good research, these people can
        immediately benefit from your work.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <em>community of theory</em>, a term I made up, is a group of people
        who share a common goal of advancing the boundaries of a conceptual
        framework. My main community of theory is "people who want to figure out
        design methods for making programming tools more usable." My knitting
        colleague is in the community of theory of "people who want to find
        correspondences between mathematical abstractions and real-world design
        problems." My self-driving advisor is in the community of theory of
        "people who want to understand the principles of efficiently
        bootstrapping a machine learning model."
      </p>
      <p>
        A community of theory is valuable because it helps you orient your
        thinking towards big ideas rather than solely the needs of the present.
        Communities of theory emphasize putting ideas in context of prior work,
        which helps avoid redundancy and find unexpected connections. And, of
        course, you have to publish papers to get through academia &mdash; it
        helps if your peer reviewers are excited about your work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Generally, communities of practice exist in industry and hobbyist
        circles. Generally, communities of theory exist in academia.
        <!-- These lines are blurry, and I am not an anthropologist building a towering social theory. Nonetheless,  -->
        Many great researchers that I have seen have both a community of
        practice and a community of theory, and critically: these communities
        are harmonious. Work in one community is valued and respected within the
        other community. Conversely, I have seen Ph.D. students bomb out of
        their program because they either (a) lacked one of these communities,
        or (b) could not find harmony between them. Here are a few supporting
        anecdotes:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            I started off my Ph.D. with no community of practice and a loose
            community of theory (systems researchers). I built very interesting
            systems, but struggled to find a community of practice who might
            adopt the systems or their ideas. I also struggled to get the
            systems community to care about the same aspects that I did, namely
            human factors.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my fourth year of the Ph.D., I pivoted hard. I shifted my
            community of practice towards Rust, where I knew people that valued
            my ideas. I shifted my community of theory towards programming
            languages, where people were far more receptive to human factors
            research. I am so much happier now than I was then, having found
            people on both sides who value the same work. As a corollary: a
            Ph.D. is a great time to figure out your respective communities!
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            I saw a Ph.D. student who did really cool work in a PL community of
            practice, even having significant members of the community as
            co-authors on their papers. But they never succeeded in convincing
            their community of theory (PL researchers) that their work was
            "interesting" enough for publication. This student left their Ph.D.
            program as a result.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            I've seen many Ph.D. students around PL/HCI who do really great
            research that can get published in HCI, SE, and sometimes PL
            conferences. Their community of theory values their contributions.
            But lacking a community of practice, these tools rarely find
            real-world adoption, and thus have limited impact. Down the line,
            this causes burnout (e.g., "the only people who read my papers are
            the peer reviewers"), and this makes it harder to find an academic
            job.
          </p>

        The practice / theory distinction is extremely common in research. The
        purpose of this note is to draw attention to the social aspects of this
        dichotomy. During my Ph.D., at no point did anyone encourage me to stop
        and think: what exactly is my community of practice? My community of
        theory? And are they in harmony? Prospective researchers should think
        hard about these questions. If the answers aren't satisfactory, then now
        is the time to improve them.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Two additional thoughts. It's less useful to think of a research
        sub-area like "programming languages", "computer vision", "complexity
        theory", etc. as your community of theory. A better rule of thumb would
        be "the set of people who review your papers", or "the set of people
        whose papers appear in the same sessions at a conference or the same
        workshop," or "the set of people who will advocate for you in the
        faculty hiring committee."
      </p>
      <p>
        A community of theory is clearly a necessary condition for success in
        academia. Publish or perish. The role of a community of practice depends
        on where your research falls on the spectrum from basic to applied. For
        researchers in, say, abstract mathematics, theory is not really distinct
        from practice, so those communities are the same. But then again, I
        personally have no idea how those researchers pick problems and have any
        confidence that their problems are worth solving. All good researchers
        have a keen sense of interesting problems, and I rely on my communities
        of practice to hone that sense. If you intentionally avoid a community
        of practice, it may be worth reflecting on what instead guides your
        problem selection.
