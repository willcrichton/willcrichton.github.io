          <h3>July 30, 2016</h3>
          <div class="abstract">We need programming languages that can evolve with us as our requirements and coding styles change. I look at prior work in components of such an extensible compiler: combining static and dynamic types, breaking the GC/systems divide, and lowering the barrier to DSLs. I consider how we can combine these features into a single language, and argue for a few design decisions to underpin this new language.</div>

          <h3>July 23, 2016</h3>
          <div class="abstract">New programming languages with a system-level compile target should choose Rust over LLVM. Targeting Rust can give new languages free package management, a type system, and memory safety while not imposing too many opinions on the language's runtime. With more work on languages, tooling, and Rust compiler development, we can create an ecosystem of beautifully interoperable programming languages.</div>

          <h3>June 19, 2016</h3>
          <div class="abstract">A single programming language is no longer enough. I predict that soon, the best programmers will fluently move between languages and the best languages will interoperate well with others. This interoperability will likely stem from strong metaprogramming facilities. I examine how we might build a programmable compiler and look at recent work toward that end.</div>
