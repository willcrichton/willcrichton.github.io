Investing today is surprisingly easy with the advent of index funds, and I'll take you step by step through both the theory and the practical parts of settings up these investments for yourself.

          <div class="abstract">A single programming language is no longer enough. I predict that soon, the best programmers will fluently move between languages and the best languages will interoperate well with others. This interoperability will likely stem from strong metaprogramming facilities. I examine how we might build a programmable compiler and look at recent work toward that end.</div>

          <h2>Extensible Compilation: Goals and Related Work</h2>
          <div class="abstract">We need programming languages that can evolve with us as our requirements and coding styles change. I look at prior work in components of such an extensible compiler: combining static and dynamic types, breaking the GC/systems divide, and lowering the barrier to DSLs. I consider how we can combine these features into a single language, and argue for a few design decisions to underpin this new language.</div>

          <h2>Programming Languages as Boy Scouts</h2>
          <div class="abstract">Programming languages are often evaluated on their efficiency and type safety, but what about friendliness? I explore how human values can be applied to programming language development, specifically looking at the twelve points of the Boy Scout Law: trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent.</div>

          <div class="abstract">I briefly analyze two competing parsing frameworks in Rust: nom, a parser combinator, and LALRPOP, an LR(1) parser generator. I show that LALRPOP can more succinctly and efficiently express grammars for text-based formats.</div>

          <h2>Rust: The New LLVM</h2>
          <div class="abstract">New programming languages with a system-level compile target should choose Rust over LLVM. Targeting Rust can give new languages free package management, a type system, and memory safety while not imposing too many opinions on the language's runtime. With more work on languages, tooling, and Rust compiler development, we can create an ecosystem of beautifully interoperable programming languages.</div>

          <div class="abstract">Carnegie Mellon is a big investment, so you should make the most out of it. If you don't pay attention, its opportunities can slip right past you. I recommend doing research, taking fewer classes, ignoring your diploma, and trying to TA a class. I also include a few quick tips for better life in Pittsburgh!</div>
