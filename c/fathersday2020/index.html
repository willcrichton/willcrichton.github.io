        I really enjoyed getting to go back and see all our old photos for the wedding. Sadly, I don't think I'll fit in a back-carrier any more, but I'm still grateful for all the years you've carried me and the family! And I do think your style has changed for the better over the years ;-)

        I hope you have a wonderful, healthy, safe Father's Day back home. I can't wait to see you and Mom once the pandemic dies down.
